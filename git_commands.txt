# How to push changes

git push -u origin master


I Had sent GIT TOKEN mentioned here to your email of Soze on 21st June 2023 so take that token from there and insert it here.

git push https://<INSERT_GIT_TOKEN>@github.com/shivangstreak/comp
.git

# Remove remote
git remote remove origin


# How to make git tokens

# Add remote
git remote add origin https://<INSERT_GIT_TOKEN>@github.com/shivangstreak/comp.git


# Pull code
git pull https://<INSERT_GIT_TOKEN>@github.com/shivangstreak/comp.git


NOTE FOR PUSHING

.git/config file looked like this when I pushed LLD changes , 
I changed https to ssh as explained in https://stackoverflow.com/questions/7438313/pushing-to-git-returning-error-code-403-fatal-http-request-failed
So try that if git push is not working.

[core]
        repositoryformatversion = 0
        filemode = true
        bare = false
        logallrefupdates = true
        ignorecase = true
        precomposeunicode = true
[remote "origin"]
        url = ssh://github.com/shivangstreak/comp.git
        fetch = +refs/heads/*:refs/remotes/origin/*
[branch "master"]
        remote = origin
        merge = refs/heads/master
