If the server doesn't support the media type, it should return HTTP status code 415 (Unsupported Media Type).
If the server cannot match any of the media type(s) listed, it should return HTTP status code 406 (Not Acceptable).

GET
A successful GET method typically returns HTTP status code 200 (OK).
If the resource cannot be found, the method should return 404 (Not Found).

If the request was fulfilled but there is no response body included in the HTTP response,
then it should return HTTP status code 204 (No Content);
for example, a search operation yielding no matches might be implemented with this behavior.

If paging has been used then for partial response HTTP status code 206 is returned
DELETE

f the delete operation is successful 200(ok),
the web server should respond with HTTP status code 204 (No Content),
 indicating that the process has been successfully handled,
  but that the response body contains no further information.
 If the resource doesn't exist, the web server can return HTTP 404 (Not Found).


POST methods
If a POST method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created).
The URI of the new resource is included in the Location header of the response.
The response body contains a representation of the resource.

If the method does some processing but does not create a new resource,
 the method can return HTTP status code 200 and include the result of the operation in the response body.
 Alternatively, if there is no result to return, the method can return HTTP status code 204 (No Content)
 with no response body.

If the client puts invalid data into the request,
the server should return HTTP status code 400 (Bad Request).
The response body can contain additional information about the error or a link to a URI that provides more details.


PUT methods
If a PUT method creates a new resource, it returns HTTP status code 201 (Created),
as with a POST method. If the method updates an existing resource,
it returns either 200 (OK) or 204 (No Content). In some cases, it might not be possible to update an existing resource.
In that case, consider returning HTTP status code 409 (Conflict).



PATCH
Here are some typical error conditions that might be encountered when processing a PATCH request,
 along with the appropriate HTTP status code.

Error condition	HTTP status code
The patch document format isn't supported.	415 (Unsupported Media Type)
Malformed patch document.	400 (Bad Request)
The patch document is valid, but the changes can't be applied to the resource in its current state.	409 (Conflict)


Asynchronous operations

Sometimes a POST, PUT, PATCH, or DELETE operation might require processing that takes a while to complete.
 If you wait for completion before sending a response to the client, it may cause unacceptable latency.
  If so, consider making the operation asynchronous. Return HTTP status code 202 (Accepted)
   to indicate the request was accepted for processing but is not completed.

You should expose an endpoint that returns the status of an asynchronous request,
so the client can monitor the status by polling the status endpoint.
Include the URI of the status endpoint in the Location header of the 202 response. For example:
HTTP/1.1 202 Accepted
Location: /api/status/12345

If the client sends a GET request to this endpoint,
the response should contain the current status of the request.
Optionally, it could also include an estimated time to completion or a link to cancel the operation.

For example:
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: application/json

{
    "status":"In progress",
    "link": { "rel":"cancel", "method":"delete", "href":"/api/status/12345" }
}

If the asynchronous operation creates a new resource,
the status endpoint should return status code 303 (See Other) after the operation completes.
In the 303 response, include a Location header that gives the URI of the new resource:
For Example :
HTTP/1.1 303 See Other
Location: /api/orders/12345


Empty sets in message bodies
Any time the body of a successful response is empty, the status code should be 204 (No Content). For empty sets,
 such as a response to a filtered request with no items, the status code should still be 204 (No Content), not 200 (OK).
