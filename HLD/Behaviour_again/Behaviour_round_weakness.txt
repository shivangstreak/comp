Whats your biggest weakness ?

Overly Absorbed :-
I believe one of my areas for improvement is that I sometimes become
overly absorbed in the technical intricacies of a project.
While a deep understanding of the technical aspects is essential in software engineering,
I've noticed that my enthusiasm for diving into details can occasionally
lead me to spend more time than necessary on certain tasks.
This heightened focus on technical depth can sometimes impact project timelines.
To address this, I've been actively working on striking a better
balance between diving deep into technical challenges and maintaining efficient progress.
For example, I've started setting time limits for certain phases of the project and ensuring
that I step back periodically to assess the bigger picture. By doing so, I can ensure that my dedication
to technical excellence complements the project's overall goals, making me a more effective senior software engineer.


Deeply engrossed in problem-solving :- (Same as above)
One aspect I've been actively working on improving is my tendency to become deeply
engrossed in problem-solving. As a software engineer,
I take pride in my ability to tackle complex technical challenges. However,
there have been instances where my determination to solve intricate problems
has caused me to spend more time than anticipated on certain tasks.
This focus on in-depth problem-solving, while valuable,
has occasionally impacted project timelines.
To mitigate this, I've been refining my time management skills and learning to
recognize when it's appropriate to delve deep into a challenge and when to step back and
assess the broader project scope. By striking this balance, I'm confident I can enhance my
contributions as a senior software engineer by channeling my problem-solving enthusiasm more effectively.


TIME MANAGEMENT :-
 One aspect I've been consistently working on improving is my time management.
 Given the dynamic nature of software engineering,
 it's easy to get engrossed in solving technical challenges and lose track of time.
 While this reflects my dedication to quality work,
 I've realized that efficient time management is crucial for meeting project deadlines and
 maintaining a healthy work-life balance. To address this, I've been adopting various
 time management techniques, such as setting specific time blocks for tasks, using
 productivity tools, and regularly assessing my progress.
 By enhancing my time management skills, I aim to consistently deliver high-quality
 work within project timelines while also maintaining a sustainable pace of work
