**Situation**:
Interviewer: "Tell me about a time when you had to implement a technical solution based on a specific customer requirement."

Shivang: "Certainly! In my role at Nutanix, I remember a time when one of our
prominent customers approached us with a unique requirement.
They wanted us to provision SQL Server Databases,
both single instance and AG (Availability Group) databases, on Windows Storage Spaces."

**Task**:
Interviewer: "What was your responsibility in this situation?"

Shivang: "The task was to design, implement, and thoroughly test a solution that would
seamlessly allow the provisioning of these SQL Server databases on Windows Storage Spaces.
The goal was to ensure compatibility, efficiency, and reliability.
Given my expertise with Windows technologies and SQL Server,
I was assigned the lead role to oversee this project from start to finish."

**Action**:
Interviewer: "How did you go about addressing this challenge?"

Shivang: "Firstly, I collaborated with my team to understand the intricate details of Windows
Storage Spaces and the specific challenges related to provisioning SQL Server databases on it.
I then mapped out a detailed plan which involved configuring the Storage Spaces,
ensuring compatibility with SQL Server, and setting up the necessary infrastructure to support Availability Groups.
During the implementation phase, I had to optimize certain configurations to ensure optimal performance and resilience.
This also involved conducting rigorous tests to guarantee the reliability and efficiency of the system.
I also engaged in continuous communication with the customer to keep them updated and gather feedback."

**Result**:
Interviewer: "What was the outcome of your efforts?"

Shivang: "Thanks to our team's concerted efforts, we successfully provisioned the SQL Server Databases on Windows Storage Spaces,
catering to both single instance and AG databases.
The customer was particularly satisfied with our prompt and efficient solution,
which not only met but exceeded their expectations.
This implementation paved the way for us to cater to similar requirements from other customers,
positioning Nutanix as a forerunner in this specialized domain."
